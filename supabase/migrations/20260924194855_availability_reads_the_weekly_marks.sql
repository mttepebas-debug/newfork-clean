-- FOUNDATION-B 5.3a: the Schedule reads availability from the weekly marks.
--
-- The grid, Edit mode, Employee Hub -> Schedule and the time off impact list
-- read the old availability versions table (the grid since the 2026-09-10
-- latency fix). They move to the employees' weekly marks and the managers'
-- private reminders, the same data the write-time check reads:
-- * app_private.schedule_week_availability() computes a week for many
--   employees at once: each time zone's clock offsets once, every mark turned
--   into instants in one pass (the rules of weekly_preference_intersections),
--   then one projection per employee and location in the shape the web
--   already draws (employees[].weekly_availability).
-- * A published shift keeps what was accepted when it was published: its
--   warning comes from its availability snapshot, never from marks added later.
--   A shift being edited is checked against today's marks and approved leave.
-- * Employee Hub -> Schedule shows an employee only their own marks, never the
--   manager's private reminder (user decision 2026-09-24).
-- * The time off impact list overlaps the shift's own hours; the old checker
--   only served to find them.
