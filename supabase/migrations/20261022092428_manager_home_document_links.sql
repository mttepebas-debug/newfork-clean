-- Needs you links (Mert 2026-10-22): a Home line about a missing document opens
-- that document's review drawer, and a line about several opens Documents
-- filtered to the location and the status. Each missing document now carries
-- its requirement id and its state, so the web builds those links.
--
-- Adds two keys to each missing_documents entry (requirement_id, status); the
-- rows, their order, gates and the rule of who may see them are unchanged.
-- The distinct now runs per requirement, so two requirements with one title
-- for one person are two entries (they are two documents to review).
